# MineralRecoveryBrines
This workbook documents a content model for interchange documents describing observations made by various processes of recovering minerals (specifically REEs) from geothermal brines. Four primary and two secondary data tabs are included in this content model spreadsheet. The four primary data tabs are Experiment (capturing the variables to describe/evaluate REE removal), Brine (capturing the variables influencing removal and describing removal media), Reactor (describing the variables in the removal (“reactor”) technique), and RemovalMediaResue (variables describing the ability of the media to be re-used). The two secondary tabs which are not required are Economics (describing the techno-economic and process economics) and FieldExperiments (for use in cases of field-based sampling and testing). 

This information exchange is constructed to record observations of REE extraction processes and can be used to compare the efficacy of those processes. For the data derived from any experiment (REE and other elements, minerals, and metals values) see the BrinesRareEarths tab in the AqueousChemisty information exchange at https://github.com/usgin-models/AqueousChemistry.
